# Style Guides

## Principles

- Justified
  - All style choices should cite a reason for the choice
- Best practices
  - Style choices should not veer from broadly accepted best practices without a very good reason
- Version controlled first
  - Style choices should enable cleaner, easier reviews of file diffs
- Consistency across languages
  - When possible and sensible similar styles should be adopted across languages

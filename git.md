# Git Style Guide

## Commit messages

<!-- TODO: need to finish this -->

### Style guide migration commits

<!-- TODO: need to revisit this after the commit messages section is complete -->

Updating a file to conform to a style guide should occur in separate commits from other substantative changes.

Unfortunately, the need to conform to a style guide can sometimes occur in the middle of other changes. In those instances, if it is possible to stash your changes and do the style guide update first, do so. If not, conform to the existing style until your changes are complete. Merge your changes and then update the file to conform to the style guide.
